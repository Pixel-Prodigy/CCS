# Project Philosophy & Core Principles

This project is a production-grade Virtual Try-On application.
All decisions must prioritize long-term maintainability, clarity, and UX quality.

## Core Principles

1. This is NOT a demo project.
2. Every feature must be scalable.
3. Readability > cleverness.
4. Mobile-first ALWAYS.
5. UX is as important as backend correctness.
6. Avoid premature optimization, but never accept sloppy architecture.
7. Assume another developer will maintain this code in 6 months.

## Mental Model

- This app will be used by:
  - Shopkeepers (daily)
  - Customers (in-store, fast decisions)
- The app must feel:
  - Calm
  - Fast
  - Reliable
  - Intuitive

If a decision hurts clarity or UX, it is the wrong decision.
